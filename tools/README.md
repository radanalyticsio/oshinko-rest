# tools for use with oshinko-reset

## server-template.yaml

This is a template that can be processed for adding an oshinko-rest-server
image to OpenShift. It maintains the default 0.0.0.0:8080 host:port option
for the server.

To use this template, an oshinko-rest-server image and a spark image must
first be tagged into the OpenShift project. Then the template must be
processed with the locations of the images. Finally, the output of the
processed template can be used to create the service and pod. Check
server-template.yaml to see the full list of parameters that may be
specified and their defaults.

## server-ui-template.yaml

This is an extension of the server-template.yaml above and includes the
oshinko-web-ui as well. This template requires that an oshinko-web-ui
image also be tagged into the OpenShift project. Setup of the service
account as described below and processing of the template is analogous
to what is described for server-template.yaml. Check server-ui-template.yaml
to see the full list of parameters that may be specified and their defaults.

## Service account

The oshinko-rest-server uses an "oshinko" service account to perform openshift
operations. This service account must be created and given the admin role in
*each* project which will use the oshinko-rest-server, for example:

Create a new project *myproject*:

    $ oc new-project myproject

Create the oshinko service account:

    $ more sa.json
    {
      "apiVersion": "v1",
      "kind": "ServiceAccount",
      "metadata": {
        "name": "oshinko"
      }
    }

    $ oc create -f sa.json

Assign the admin role:

    $ oc policy add-role-to-user admin system:serviceaccount:myproject:oshinko -n myproject

## Sample template usage

Example usage with an internal registry at 172.30.159.57:5000, and a project
named "myproject":

    $ oc process -f server-template.yaml -v OSHINKO_SERVER_IMAGE=172.30.159.57:5000/myproject/oshinko-rest-server,OSHINKO_CLUSTER_IMAGE=172.30.159.57:5000/myproject/openshift-spark > server-template.json
    $ oc create -f server-template.json

## Sample script to setup oshinko
Use oshinko-setup.sh to quickly deploy the oshinko bits into an OpenShift cluster.
The cluster is generated by downloading the OpenShift tarball and using
the `oc cluster up` command.

Example usage:

    $ oshinko-setup.sh -w mywebui.10.16.40.70.xip.io

This will setup a cluster and install oshinko with the oshinko web ui
accessible at mywebui.10.16.40.70.xip.io (using xip.io is a way to
get DNS to resolve to the IP, 10.16.40.70 in the example).  You would
need to use a routeable IP address of your machine.

    $ oshinko-setup.sh -w myweb.10.16.40.70.xip.io -s myregistry.com:5000/sparkimage

This will setup a cluster and install the oshinko bits as in the previous
example, but will use a custom Spark image that you specified with the
-s flag.  The custom image must use a built-in CMD (specified in the
Dockerfile) to start Spark and it must also expect an enviornment variable,
SPARK_MASTER_ADDRESS to be set in the worker nodes.  The oshinko rest server
will fill-in that value at spawn-time to be set to the address of the Spark
master node.  For the master node, that value will not be set.  The absence
of that value is what tells Spark to run as the master node.

It should be noted, that if you do not use a custom Spark image with
the -s flag, a Spark image will be built for you from the openshift-spark
repository.

## Sample script to deploy oshinko from existing containers

The `oshinko-deploy.sh` script can deploy the oshinko suite into an already
running OpenShift instance. It requires that certain images exist in your
local docker registry, namely; `oshinko-rest-server`, `oshinko-webui`,
`openshift-pyspark`, and optionally `radanalytics-pyspark`.

With these in place, the script will deploy and setup oshinko into a project
of your choosing. This script also assumes that you can run docker commands
without an escalation of privileges.

example usage:

    $ ./oshinko-deploy.sh -w myweb.10.16.40.70.xip.io -s myregistry.com:5000/sparkimage -p myproject -u developer

Running this will deploy oshinko into the project `myproject` using the
`developer` user, it will expose the webui at
`http://myweb.10.16.40.70.xio.io`, and oshinko will use the spark image from
`myregistry.com:5000/sparkimage` as the base for deployment.

### A note on permissions

Some of the operations in this script may require superuser privileges
depending on the configuration of your system and OpenShift deployment. In
specific, the usage of docker and the permissions for logging in as the
`system:admin` user in OpenShift are assumed. If these are not configured for
non-root access in your system, then you may need to invoke this script using
the `sudo` command or as the `root` user.
