# oshinko-rest
REST api for a spark cluster management app

## Development notes

This project is using an OpenAPI definition for its API, located at
`api/swagger.yaml`. The code in this project has been mostly generated by
using the tooling from (go-swagger)[https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger].

Due to the generated nature of this codebase, there are a few places to
investigate when looking to add functionality:

* `restapi/configure_oshinko_rest.go`, this file is generated by the go-swagger
  tooling, but is deemed safe to edit as the entry point for endpoint handlers.

* `handlers/*`, this package has been added to help separate the endpoint
  handler functions. New handlers, or handler functionality, should be added
  here.

### Requirements for building

* godep, https://github.com/tools/godep
* go-swagger, https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger (only needed for
  validating the api file)

### Running as a Docker container

To run the rest server as a container, use the `make image` target to build a
container image. With the image built, it can be started from the command
line using a syntax similar to:

    $ docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 oshinko-rest-server

This will start the server listening on `0.0.0.0:8080`, which is the 
default option. To customize this behavior, the environment variables
`OSHINKO_SERVER_HOST` and `OSHINKO_SERVER_PORT` can be specified to the
`docker run` command to specify an address and port, respectively.
